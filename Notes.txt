rotation issue:

the rotation box raycast check, checks the position for where the cast was hit on the child out of bounds compared to the parent transform position, however, because the checks are on if statements, the "if out of bounds child is to the right/left" is before the "bottom/above" check, therefore if an S, Z, L or J block rotates while close to the bottom bounds, and the child that triggers the out of bounds cast is still to the right or left of the center, then it will treat it as if it needs to move to the right or left because those checks are first. this will not correct the position and will end up moving the block until it is no longer touching the bottom bounds, i.e the play area (this is the reason why it looks like it teleports out of the play area bc if hanging piece is checked first, then move right/left is called until it is no longer touching the bounds).
